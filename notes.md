# week 5 notes

The following are the various keyboard shortcuts and solutions to problems I ran in to this week.

NOTE: “+” refers to pressing both keys simultaneously, not pressing the “+” key

### General
- command + A = select all 

### Inkscape
- 6 + ] rotate clockwise
- 6 + [ rotate counterclockwise
- clicking on an object, path + trace bitmap + remove background 
    - gets rid of a white background in an imported image
- For some reason the file I was working on did not come up in “open recent” after the program crashed my computer. I solved this by searching my whole computer. for [key word] + .svg, but I still don’t know why this happened
- stop cusp node snapping (the annoying thing where objects “cusp to corner” with other objects when you try to move them a short amount): make sure upper right button (“enable snapping”) is off. 
- [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TroISAC_wHU) tutorial on objects and paths (specifically helped me figure out how to manipulate objects/paths to create semi-curved shapes)
